#1.Create Tuple (Name, Age, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate)
patient = ("Ali Rafii", 35, "120/80", 72)

#2.Access Age & Heart Rate
print("Age:", patient[1])
print("Heart Rate:", patient[3])

#3.Explanation why tuples are suitable for storing patient vitals.
#-Immutable: The recorded vitals cannot be accidentally altered, ensuring data integrity for medical records.
#-Secure: Their immutability prevents tampering, securing sensitive patient data.
#-Efficient in memory: They use less memory than lists, which is optimal for storing simple, fixed data.
#-Suitable for Permanent medical records: They perfectly represent a fixed snapshot of a patient's state at a specific point in time.

#4.Convert to List, Update & Reconvert
patient_list = list(patient)
patient_list[3] = 75
patient = tuple(patient_list)
print(patient)

#5.Tuple of 5 Patients & Extract Names
patients = (
    ("Ali", 30, "120/80", 70),
    ("Sara", 28, "110/70", 72),
    ("David", 40, "130/85", 76),
    ("Mary", 33, "115/75", 74),
    ("Omar", 50, "140/90", 80)
)

names = [p[0] for p in patients]
print(names)
